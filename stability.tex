\section{Externally definable sets}
\label{externally}

\def\ceq#1#2#3{\parbox{25ex}{$\displaystyle #1$}\medrel{#2}$\displaystyle  #3$}

Let $\grC,\grD\subseteq\U^{\gr z}$.
The set $\grD\cap A^{\gr z}$ is called the \emph{trace\/} of $\grD$ over $A$.
We write $\grC=_A\grD$ if  $\grC$ and $\grD$ have the same trace on $A$.

Let $p({\mr x})\subseteq L(\U)$ be a consistent type.
Recall from Section~\ref{invariant_sets} that for every formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ we define

\ceq{\hfill\emph{$\gr\D_{p,\phi}$}}{=}{\Big\{{\gr a}\in\U^{\gr z}\ :\ \phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr a})\in p\Big\}.}

We say that $\grD$ is \emph{externally definable\/} if it is of the form ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ for a type $p(x)$ in $S(\U)$ or $S_\phi(\U)$.
We say that $\grD$ is externally definable \emph{by $p({\mr x})$ and $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$}.

Equivalently, a set $\grD$ is externally definable if it is the trace over $\U$ of a set which is definable in some elementary extension of $\U$.
More precisely, $\grD$ is the trace on $\U$ of a set of the form $\phi({\mr ^{*\kern-.3ex}b}\,;{\gr ^{*\kern-.2ex}\U})$ where $ ^{*\kern-.2ex}\U$ is elementary extension of $\U$ and ${\mr  ^{*\kern-.3ex}b}\in {}^{*\kern-.2ex}\U^{|{\mr x}|}$.
The latter interpretation explains the terminology.

\noindent\llap{\textcolor{red}{\Large\danger}\kern1.5ex}We prefer to deal with external definability in a different, though equivalent, way.
This is not the most common approach.

\begin{definition}\label{def_approx}
We say that $\grD$ is \emph{approximated\/} by the formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ if for every finite $B$ there is a tuple ${\mr a}\in\U^{\mr x}$ such that $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr B})=\grD\cap B^{\gr z}$.
We call $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ the \emph{sort} of $\grD$.
If in addition $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr\U})\subseteq\grD$, we say that  $\grD$ is \emph{approximated from below}.
Equivalently, we say that  $\grD$ is approximated from below if for every finite ${\gr B}\subseteq\grD$ there is a tuple ${\mr a}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that  ${\gr B}\subseteq\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr\U})\subseteq\grD$.
The dual notion of \emph{approximation from above\/} is defined as expected (and coincides with $\neg\grD$ being approximated by $\neg\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ from below).\QED
\end{definition} 

The following proposition is clear by compactness.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_approx=external}
   For every $\grD$ the following are equivalent
   \begin{itemize}
   \item[1.] $\grD$ is approximated by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$
   \item[2.] $\grD$ is externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.\QED
   \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

The rest of this section is only required in Chapter~\ref{vc}.

Approximability from below is an adaptation to our context of the notion of \textit{having an honest definition} in \cite{CS}.

\begin{definition}\label{def_defble_type}
We say that the global type $p\in S_{{\mr x}}(\U)$ is \emph{honestly definable\/} if for every $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ the set ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ is approximated from below (by some formula).
We say that $p$ is \emph{definable\/} if the sets ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ are all definable (over $\U$).
Note that the terminology is misleading: honestly definable is weaker than definable.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Every definable set is trivially approximable.
Sets may be approximable by different formulas.
For instance, if $T=T_{\rm dlo}$, then $\D=\{z\in\U:a\le z\le b\}$ is approximable both from below and from above by the formula $x_1<z<x_2$ though it is not definable by this formula.

Now, let $T=T_{\rm rg}$.
Then every $\D\subseteq\U$ is approximable and, when $\D$ has small infinite cardinality, it is approximable from above but not from below.\QED
\end{example}

In Definition~\ref{def_approx}, the sort $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is fixed (otherwise any set would be approximable) but this requirement of uniformity may be dropped if we allow $B$ to have larger cardinality.

\begin{proposition}\label{lem_approx_nonunif}
For every $\grD$ the following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\grD$ is approximable
\item[2.] for every $C\subseteq\U$ of cardinality $\le|L|$ there is $\psi({\gr z})\in L(\U)$ such that $\psi({\gr C})=\grD\cap C^{\gr z}$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
To prove \ssf{2}$\IMP$\ssf{1} assume \ssf{2} and negate \ssf{1} for a contradiction.
For each formula $\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ choose a finite set $B$ such that $\psi({\mr b}\,;{\gr\U})\neq_B\grD$ for every ${\mr b}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$.
Let $C$ be the union of all these finite sets.
Clearly $|C|\le|L|$.
By \ssf{2} there are a formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and a tuple ${\mr c}$ such that $\phi({\mr c}\,;{\gr C})=\grD\cap C^{\gr z}$, contradicting the definition of $C$.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{prop_approx_el_eq}
If $\grD\subseteq\U^{\gr z}$ is approximated by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ then so is any $\grC$ such that $\grC\equiv\grD$, see Section~\ref{expansions} for the notation.
In fact, if the set $\grD$ is approximable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ then for every $n$

\hfil$\displaystyle\A {\gr z_1},\dots,{\gr z_n}\;\E {\mr x}\ \bigwedge^n_{i=1}\big[\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z_i})\ \iff\ {\gr z_i}\in{\gr \D}\big]$.


So the same holds for any $\grC\equiv\grD$.
A similar remark apply to approximability from below and from above (e.g.\@ for approximability from below, add the conjunct $\A {\gr z}\,\big[\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\imp {\gr z}\in\grD\big]$ to the formula above).\QED
\end{remark}

From the following easy observation of Chernikov and Simon~\cite{CS} we obtain an interesting (and misterious) quantifier elimination result originally due to Shelah, see Corollary~\ref{corol_sh_exp_qe} below.

% \begin{proposition}
% Let $\C\subseteq\U^{|{\gr z},w|}$ be approximated from below by the formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z},w)$. Then $\grD=\big\{{\gr z}:\E w\ \big({\gr z}\,w\in\C\big)\big\}$ is approximated from below by the formula $\E w\,\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z}\,w)$.
% \end{proposition}
% 
% \begin{proof}
% Let $B\subseteq\U$ be finite. 
% We want ${\mr a}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that 
% 
% \ceq{\ssf{a.}\hfill \E w\ \big({\gr b}\,w\in\C\big)}{\iff}{\E w\,\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b}\,w)}\hfill for every ${\gr b}\in B^{\gr z}$
% 
% \ceq{\ssf{b.}\hfill \A {\gr z}\;\Big[\E w\,\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr z}\,w)}{\imp}{\E w\ \big({\gr z}\,w\in\C\big)\Big]}
% 
% Let $C\subseteq\U$ be a finite set such that

% 
% As $\C$ is approximable from below, there is an ${\mr a}$ such that
% 
% \ceq{\ssf{a'.}\hfill {\gr b}\,c\in\C}{\iff}{\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b}\,c)}\hfill for every ${\gr b}\,c\in \big(B\cup C\big)^{|{\gr z}\,w|}$
% 
% \ceq{\ssf{b'.}\hfill \A {\gr z}\,w\ \Big[\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr z}\,w)}{\imp}{{\gr z}\,w\in\C\Big]}
% 
% We obtain \ssf{b} from \ssf{b'} simply by logic. 
% Implication $\imp$ in \ssf{a} follows from \ssf{a'} and \ssf{c}. 
% Implication $\pmi$ follows from \ssf{b}.
% \end{proof}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_sh_exp_qe}
Let $\C\subseteq\U^{|y\,{\gr z}|}$ be approximated from below by the formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;y\,{\gr z})$.
Then $\grD=\big\{{\gr z}:\E y\ \big(y\,{\gr z}\in\C\big)\big\}$ is approximated from below by the formula $\E y\,\phi({\mr x}\,;y\,{\gr z})$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
\def\vl{\gr}
Let $B\subseteq\U$ be finite. 
We want ${\mr a}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that 

\ceq{\ssf{a.}\hfill \E y\ \big(y\,{\vl b}\in\C\big)}{\iff}{\E y\,\phi({\mr a}\,;y\,{\vl b})}\hfill for every ${\vl b}\in B^{|{\vl z}|}$

\ceq{\ssf{b.}\hfill \A {\vl z}\;\Big[\E y\,\phi({\mr a}\,;y\,{\vl z})}{\imp}{\E y\ \big(y\,{\vl z}\in\C\big)\Big]}

Let $D\subseteq\U$ be a finite set such that

As $\C$ is approximable from below, there is an ${\mr a}$ such that

\ceq{\ssf{a'.}\hfill d\,{\vl b}\in\C}{\iff}{\phi({\mr a}\,;d\,{\vl b})}\hfill for every $d\,{\vl b}\in \big(D\cup B\big)^{|y\,{\vl z}|}$

\ceq{\ssf{b'.}\hfill \A y\,{\vl z}\ \Big[\phi({\mr a}\,;y\,{\vl z})}{\imp}{y\,{\vl z}\in\C\Big]}

We obtain \ssf{b} from \ssf{b'} simply by logic. 
Implication $\imp$ in \ssf{a} follows from \ssf{a'} and \ssf{c}. 
Implication $\pmi$ follows from \ssf{b}.
\end{proof}



\begin{corollary}
If $p\in S_{{\mr x}}(\U)$ is honestly definable then the family of sets externally definable by $p$ is closed under quantifiers and Boolean combinations. 
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
The sets externally definable by $p({\mr x})$ are always closed under Boolean operations. By the proposition above, they are closed under quantifiers. 
\end{proof}

% Let ${\gr z}=\<z_i:i<\lambda\>$ and let $\grD\subseteq\U^{\gr z}$. 
% For $I\subseteq\lambda$ we write $\E z_{\restriction I}\,\grD$ for the projection of $\grD$ to the $\lambda\sm I$ coordinates, i.e.\@ the set $\{b_{\restriction\lambda\sm I}: {\gr b}\in\grD\}$. 
% Expand the language with a symbol for $\E z_{\restriction I}\,\grD$ for every finite $I\subseteq\lambda$. 
% Then the theory of $\U$ in the expanded language has positive $\Delta$-quantifier elimination, for $\Delta=L\cup\big\{\E z_{\restriction I}\,\grD: I\subseteq\lambda\textrm{ finite}\big\}$, see Section~\hyperref[eliminazionequantificatoricriterio]{\ref*{elimination}.\ref*{eliminazionequantificatoricriterio}}.

\section{Ladders and definability}


%Here we write \emph{$\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})^*$\/} for the partitioned formula where the order of the two tuples is inverted (i.e.\@ it is the opposite of what displayed).

Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L(\U)$ be a partitioned formula (these have been introduced in Definition~\ref{def_partitioned_fla}).
We say that $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i<\alpha\>$ is a \emph{ladder sequence\/} for $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ if for every $i<j<\alpha$


\ceq{\hfill\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_j})}{\wedge}{\neg\phi({\mr a_j}\,;{\gr b_i})}

We say that the formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is \emph{stable\/} if for some finite $n$ all ladders have length at most $n$. Otherwise we say it is \emph{unstable} or that it has the \emph{order property}.

Note that by compactness if a formulas admits ladder sequences of unbounded finite length, then it admits an infinite one.

\begin{exercise}
   Prove that the following are equivalent
   \begin{itemize}
   \item[1.]  $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ has a a ladder sequence of length $\omega$
   \item[2.] there are set ${\mr A}$ and a sequnce $\<{\gr b_i} : i<\omega\>$ such that $\phi({\mr A}\,;{\gr b_i})\subset\phi({\mr A}\,;{\gr b_{i+1}})$ for every $i<\omega$.\QED
   \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

We can also required that the ladder is an indiscernible sequence. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_sability_indiscernibility}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L(A)$.
  Then the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[1.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable
    \item[2.] $\phi({\mr a_0}\,;{\gr b_1})\imp\phi({\mr a_1}\,;{\gr b_0})$ for every $A$-indiscernible sequence $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i<\omega\>$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  (2$\IMP$1) \ Assume $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is unstable.
  By compactness, there is a ladder sequence $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i<\omega\>$.
  Let $\<{\mr a'_i}\,;{\gr b'_i} : i<\omega\>$ be a sequence of $A$-indiscernibles with the same EM-type as $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i<\omega\>$.
  Then $\phi({\mr a'_0}\,;{\gr b'_1})$ and $\neg\phi({\mr a'_1}\,;{\gr b'_0})$.

  (2$\IMP$1) Immediate by indiscernibility.
\end{proof}
%It is clear that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable if and only if $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})^*$ is stable.

%Suppose $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is unstable and let $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i<\omega\>$ be a ladder sequence. By padding redundant variables, we can read $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ as a formula $\phi({\mr x}\,{\gr z}\,;{\mr y}\,{\gr w})$. Then $\phi({\mr x}\,{\gr z}\,;{\mr y}\,{\gr w})$ defines the order of the sequence $\<{\mr a_i}\,{\gr b_i} : i<\omega\>$. For this reason it is also common to say that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ has the \emph{order property}, this simply means that it is unstable. 

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_stab_Boole}
  Every Boolean combination of stable formulas is stable.
  Moreover, if $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ then  $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})^{\rm op}$ and $\phi({\mr x},{\mr x'}\,;{\gr z},{\gr z'})$ are also stable formula (in the latter ${\mr x'}$ and ${\gr z'}$ are dummy variables).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  It suffices to consider conjunction and negation.
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z}),\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L(\U)$ be stable formulas.
  By Theorem~\ref{thm_sability_indiscernibility}, it is immediate that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable.
  As for negation, notice that if $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i<n\>$ is a ladder sequence for $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ then  $\<{\mr a_{n-i}}\,;{\gr b_{n-i}} : i<n\>$ is a ladder sequence for $\neg\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.

  The second claim is immediate.
\end{proof}

The following theorem claims what is arguably one of the most important properties of stable formulas: any set that is externally definable by a stable formula is definable (by a related formula).

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_def_stable_formula}
Any $\grD\subseteq\U^{\gr z}$ approximated by a stable formula is definable.
More precisely, if $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is a stable formula that approximates $\grD$ then there are ${\mr a_{1,1}},\dots,{\mr a_{n,m}}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that 

\ceq{\hfill {\gr z}\in\grD}{\iff}{\bigvee^n_{i=1}\bigwedge^m_{j=1}\phi({\mr a_{i,j}}\,;{\gr z})}
\end{theorem}

Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula2} will prove the converse: if every set approxiamted by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is definable then $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable.

\begin{proof}
  The theorem follows immediately from the two lemmas below.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
If $\grD$ is approximated from below by a stable formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ then

\ceq{\hfill {\gr z}\in\grD}{\iff}{\bigvee^n_{i=0}\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr z})}

for some ${\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_n}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The elements ${\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_n}$ are defined recursively together with some auxiliary elements ${\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_{n-1}}\in\grD$.

Suppose ${\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_{n-1}}$ have been defined (this assumption is empty if $n=0$).
We first define ${\mr a_n}$, then ${\gr b_n}$. 
Choose ${\mr a_n}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that ${\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_{n-1}}\in\phi({\mr a_n}\,;{\gr\U})\subseteq\grD$.
This is possible because $\grD$ is approximated from below.
Now, if possible, choose ${\gr b_n}$ such that

\ceq{\hfill{\gr b_n}}{\in}{\grD\sm\bigcup^n_{i=0}\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr\U})}.

Then $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i\le n\>$ is a ladder sequence. 
By stability, for some $n$, the tuple ${\gr b_n}$ does not exist.
This yields the required ${\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_n}$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_stab_approx_below}
If $\grD$ is approximated by a stable formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
Then, for some $m$, the formula 

\ceq{\hfill\psi({\mr x_0},\dots,{\mr x_m}\,;{\gr z})}{=}{\bigwedge^m_{j=0}\phi({\mr x_j}\,;{\gr z})}

approximates $\grD$ from below.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $m$ be such that there is no ladder sequence for $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ of length greater then $m$.
Let ${\gr C}\subseteq\grD$ be finite.
We prove that there are some ${\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_m}$ such that ${\gr C}\subseteq\psi({\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_m}\,;{\gr\U})\subseteq\grD$.
As in the proof above, we define by recursion a ladder sequence for $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
Suppose that ${\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_{n-1}}$ and ${\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_{n-1}}\notin\grD$ have been defined.
We first define ${\mr a_n}$, then ${\gr b_n}$. 
Choose ${\mr a_n}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that 

\hfil${\gr C}\ \subseteq\ \phi({\mr a_n}\,;{\gr\U})\ \subseteq\ \U^{\gr z}\sm\{{\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_{n-1}}\}$.

This ${\mr a_n}$ exists, because $\grD$ is approximated by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
(Apply Definition~\ref{def_approx} with any $B$ such that ${\gr C}\cup\{{\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_{n-1}}\}\subseteq B^{\gr z}$.)
Then, if possible, let ${\gr b_n}$ such that

\ceq{\hfill{\gr b_n}}{\in}{\bigcap^n_{i=0}\phi({\mr a_i},{\gr\U})\sm\grD}

This procedure has to stop at some $n\le m$.
Hence the required parameters are ${\mr a_1},\dots,{\mr a_n}={\mr a_{n+1}}=\dots={\mr a_{m}}$.
\end{proof}

% \begin{lemma}\label{lem_stable3}
% If $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is a stable formula then for every $m$ the formula $\psi({\mr x_0},\dots,{\mr x_m}\,;{\gr z})$ defined above is stable.
% \end{lemma}

% \begin{proof}
% It suffices to prove that if $\phi_1({\mr x_1}\,;{\gr z})\wedge\phi_2({\mr x_2}\,;{\gr z})$ is unstable then one of the formulas $\phi_n({\mr x_i}\,;{\gr z})$ is unstable. For simplicity, we use that instability implies the existence of an infinite ladder (this uses compactness, apparently contradicting Remark~\ref{rem_sability_no_compactness}). We leave to the reader to adapt the argument so that compactness is not required.

% Let ${\mr a^1_i},{\mr a^2_i}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ and ${\gr b_i}\in\U^{\gr z}$ be such that 

% \ceq{\hfill i\le j}{\IFF}{\phantom{\neg}\phi_1({\mr a^1_i}\,;{\gr b_j})\wedge\phi_2({\mr a^2_i}\,;{\gr b_j})}\hfill for all $i,j<\omega$

% For $n=1,2$ let $H_n\subseteq{\omega\choose 2}$ contain those pairs $j<i$ such that $\neg\phi_n({\mr a^n_i}\,;{\gr b_j})$. 
% By the equivalence above $H_1\cup H_2={\omega\choose 2}$. 
% By the Ramsey Theorem there is an infinite set $H$ such that ${H\choose 2}\subseteq H_n$ for at least one of $n=1,2$. Suppose $H_1$ for definiteness. So, we obtain an infinite sequence $a^1_i$, $b_i$ such that

% \ceq{\hfill j<i}{\IFF}{\neg\phi_1({\mr a^1_i}\,;{\gr b_j})}\hfill for all $i,j<\omega$

% hence $\phi_1({\mr x_1}\,;{\gr z})$ is unstable.
% \end{proof}

By Lemma~\ref{lem_stab_Boole} the formula $\psi({\mr x_0},\dots,{\mr x_m}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable therefore this concludes the proof of Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula}.\QED 

\begin{remark}\label{rem_sability_no_compactness}
  Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula} is often casted in the following  apparently more general form.
  Let $\mrA\subseteq\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ and $\grB\subseteq\U^{\gr z}$.
  We say that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable between $\mrA$ and $\grB$ if for some $n$ no ladder of length $n$ exists with ${\mr a_i}\in\mrA$ and ${\gr b_i}\in\grB$.

  Let $\grD\subseteq\grB$ be approximable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge {\mr x}\in\mrA$.
  Then for any such $\grD$ there are ${\mr a_{1,1}},\dots,{\mr a_{n,m}}\in \mrA$ such that 
  
  \ceq{\hfill {\gr b}\in\grD}{\iff}{\bigvee^n_{i=1}\bigwedge^m_{j=1}\phi({\mr a_{i,j}}\,;{\gr b}).}
  
  The proof is essentially the same. 
  In fact, elementarity and saturation as only been used to prove that conjunctions of stable formulas is stable.
  Exercise~\ref{ex_stability_conjunction} suggests a finitary proof of this fact.\QED
\end{remark} 

\begin{exercise}
  Let $\phi(x,y)\in  L$, where $|x|=|y|=1$.
  Suppose there is an infinite set $A\subseteq\U$ such that $\phi(a,b)\niff\phi(b,a)$ for every two distinct $a,b\in A$.
  Prove that $\phi(x\,;y)$ is unstable.\QED
\end{exercise}


% \begin{exercise}\label{ex_harrington}
%   Prove the following claim (a version of Harrington's mysterious Lemma cfr.~\cite[Lemma 8.3.4]{TZ}).
%   Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ be a stable formula and suppose $\grB\subseteq\U^{\gr z}$ and $\mrA\subseteq\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ are approximated by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and  $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})^{\rm op}$, respectively.
%   Then at least one of the conditions \ssf{1} and \ssf{2} below occurs
  
%   \begin{itemize}
%   \item[1.]

%   Hence it suffices to prove that \ssf{1a}$\IMP$\ssf{1b} and \ssf{2a}$\IMP$\ssf{2b}.
%   We only prove the first.
%   The second follows because $\neg\grB$ and $\neg\mrA$ are approximated by $\neg\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and  $\neg\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})^*$, respectively.

\section{Stability and the number of types}


The following proposition highlights the connection between the stability of $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and the cardinality of $S_\phi(\U)$, equivalently the number of sets externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$. 

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_def_stable_formula2}
   The following are equivalent
   \begin{itemize}
     \item[1.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable
     \item[2.] every subset of $\U^{\gr z}$ that is externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is definable
     \item[3.] there are $\le\kappa$ subsets of $\U^{\gr z}$ that are externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$
     \item[4.] there are $<2^\kappa$ subsets of $\U^{\gr z}$ that are externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
   \end{itemize}
 \end{theorem}
 
 \begin{proof}
 \ssf{1}$\IMP$\ssf{2} Clear by Proposition~\ref{prop_approx=external} and Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula}.
 
 \ssf{2}$\IMP$\ssf{3}$\IMP$\ssf{4} Obvious.
 
 \ssf{4}$\IMP$\ssf{1} Suppose that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is not stable.
 By compactness there is a ladder sequence  $\<{\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_i} : i\in I\>$ where $I,<_I$ a dense linear order of cardinality $\kappa$ with $2^\kappa$ cuts, where by \textit{cut\/} we mean a subset $c\subseteq I$ that is closed downward.
 For every such $c\subseteq I$ we pick a global type
 
 \ceq{\hfill p_c({\mr x} ) }{\supseteq}{\big\{\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_i})\iff i\in c\ :\ i\in I\big\}.}
 
 Clearly the sets ${\gr\D_{p_c,\,\phi} }$ are all distinct.
 \end{proof}


Binary trees of formulas have been introduced in Definition~\ref{def_tree_formulas}.
Here we restrict to trees of a particular form.
Namely, $\<\psi_s:s\in 2^{<\omega}\>$  where $\psi_\0=\top$ and for $s\in 2^{<\omega}$ and $i\in 2$ we have $\psi_{s^\frown 0}({\mr x})=\neg\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_s})$ and $\psi_{s^\frown 1}({\mr x})=\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_s})$.
If we define $\phi^0=\neg\phi$ and $\phi^1=\phi$ the condition of concistency becomes for every $s\in 2^\omega$ the type $\{\phi^{s_n}({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction n}})\ :\ n<\omega\}$.


% Set the overall layout of the tree
\tikzstyle{level 1}=[level distance=3.5cm, sibling distance=2.5cm]
\tikzstyle{level 2}=[level distance=3.5cm, sibling distance=1.2cm]
\tikzstyle{level 3}=[level distance=2.5cm, sibling distance=0.5cm]
\tikzstyle{level 4}=[level distance=0.5cm, sibling distance=0.5cm]

% Define styles for bags and leafs
\tikzstyle{bag0} = [text width=1.5ex, align=left]
\tikzstyle{bag} = [text width=7.5ex, align=right]
%\tikzstyle{end} = [circle, minimum width=3pt,fill, inner sep=0pt]

When a binary tree of this form exists, we say that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ has the \emph{binary tree property}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_count_types}
  The following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is unstable
  \item[2.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ has the binary tree property.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \ssf{1}$\IMP$\ssf{2}.
  The argument is the same as in the proof of Lemma~\ref{lem_bin_tree}.
  Assume \ssf1. 
  By Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula2} there are $2^\kappa$ sets externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
  Then there is ${\gr b_\0}\in{\U^z}$ such that there are $2^\kappa$ sets ${\gr\D}$ externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and such that ${\gr b_\0}\in{\gr\D}$ and $2^\kappa$ sets such that ${\gr b_\0}\notin{\gr\D}$.

  Assume inductively that ${\gr b}:2^n\to{\gr\U^z}$ is such that for all $s\in2^n$ and $r\in2^{n+1}$ there are $2^\kappa$ sets ${\gr\D}$ externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and such that ${\gr b_{s\restriction i}}\in\D\iff r(i)=1$.
  Reasoning as above we can extend ${\gr b}$ to a map ${\gr b'}:2^{n+1}\to{\gr\U^z}$ with the same property.

  % We show that if there is a ladder of length $m=2^n$, say $a_1,\dots,a_{m-1}$ and $b_0,\dots,b_{m-1}$, then there is a branching tree $\bar a'$ of height $n$.
  
  % The branching tree $\bar b'=\<b'_r\, :\, r\in{}^{<n}2\>$ is defined as follows

  % \quad $a'_r=b_h$\quad  where $h$ is obtained reading $r^\frown1^\frown0^{n-|r|-1}$ as an $n$-digit binary number.

  % To verify \ssf{2r} we define for $s\in{}^n2$ 
  
  % \quad $a'_s=b_k$\quad  where $k$ is obtained reading $s$ as an $n$-digit binary number.

  % Then it is easy to verify that for all pairs $r\subset s\in{}^n2$

  % \ceq{\hfill\phi(b'_r\,;a'_s)}
  % {\IFF}
  % {\phi(a_h\,;b_k)}\hfill where $h$ and $k$ are like above

  % \ceq{}
  % {\IFF}
  % {h\le k}

  % \ceq{}
  % {\IFF}
  % {r^\frown1^\frown0^{n-|r|-1}\ \le\ s}\hfill  as $n$-digit binary numbers

  % \ceq{}
  % {\IFF}
  % {r^\frown1\ \subseteq\ s}

  \ssf{2}$\IMP$\ssf{1}. From $\ssf{2}$, by compactness, there is a binary tree of height $\kappa$. 
  Hence there are $2^\kappa$ sets that are externally definable by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
  Therefore, by Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula2}, $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is not stable.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{corol_count_types}
The following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is a stable formula
\item[2.] $\big|S_{\phi}(A)\big|\le|A|$ for all countable sets $A$
\item[3.] $\big|S_{\phi}(A)\big|<2^{|A|}$ for all countable sets $A$.
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  The corollary follows immediately from Lemma~\ref{lem_bin_tree} and Theorem~\ref{thm_count_types}.
\end{proof}

We use binary trees to prove the following fundamental lemma (attributed by Harnik and Harrington to Martin Ziegler).

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_ziegler}
   Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z}),\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z}) \in L(A)$.
   Let ${\gr b}\in\U^{\gr z}$.
   Assume that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is stable and that $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})\vee\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ is finitely satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$.
   Then $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ or $\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ is finitely satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$.
\end{lemma} 

\begin{proof}
  Negate the theorem. 
  Then there are two models containing $A$, the first omitting $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$, the second omitting $\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$.
  It is easy to see that we can expand these models to two substructures $\V_0$ and $\V_1$ that are $A$-isomorphic to $\U$ and such that $\V_0=\neg\phi({\mr\V_0}\,;{\gr b})$ and $\V_1=\neg\psi({\mr\V_1}\,;{\gr b})$.

  Let $f_i:\U\to\V_i$ be the $A$-isomorphisms mentioned above. 
  Let $\V_\0=\U$ and ${\gr b_\0}={\gr b}$.
  Define inductively for every $s\in 2^{<\omega}$ 

  \hfil$\V_{s^\frown i}=f_i[\V_s]$\ \ and\ \ ${\gr b_{s\frown i}}=f_i({\gr b_s})$.

  Then from the inclusion above we obtain

  \#\hfil$\V_{s\frown0}^{{\mr x}}\subseteq\neg\phi({\mr\V_{s\frown0}}\,;{\gr b_s})$ \ \ and \ \  $\V_{s\frown1}^{{\mr x}}\subseteq\neg\psi({\mr\V_{s\frown1}}\,;{\gr b_s})$.

  We prove that the branches of the tree $\<\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_s})\ :\  s\in2^{<\omega}\>$ are (finitely) consistent. 
  By Theorem~\ref{thm_count_types}, this contradicts the stability of $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
  Assume provisionally that there is a formula $\theta({\mr x})\in L(A)$ such that
  
  \ceq{\#\#\hfill\theta({\mr x})}{\imp}{\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})\vee\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})}
  
  Let $s\in2^n$ be given.
  Let ${\mr a}\in\theta({\mr\V_s})$ be arbitrary. We claim that ${\mr a}$ witnesses the concistency of  $\{\phi^{s_i}({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})\ :\ i<n\}$.
  As $\V_s\preceq\V_{s\restriction i}$, we have that ${\mr a}\in\theta({\mr\V_{s\restriction i}})$.
  We prove that $\phi^{s_i}({\mr a}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})$.
  If $s_i=0$ then from \# we obtain $\V_{s\restriction(i+1)}^{{\mr x}}\subseteq\phi^0({\mr\V_{s\restriction(i+1)}}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})$ and $\phi^0({\mr a}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})$ follows by elementarity.
  If $s_i=1$, from the second inclusion in \# we obtain $\V_{s\restriction(i+1)}^{{\mr x}}\subseteq\neg\psi({\mr\V_{s\restriction(i+1)}}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})$.
  Therefore, from $\theta({\mr a})$ and \#\#, we obtain that $\V_{s\restriction(i+1)}^{{\mr x}}\subseteq\phi({\mr\V_{s\restriction(i+1)}}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})$ and $\phi^1({\mr a}\,;{\gr b_{s\restriction i}})$ follows.

  We are left with proving that the provisional assumption is redundant.
  By Exercise~\ref{ex_almost_satisfied} there is a formula $\theta({\mr\bar x})\in L(A)$ such that

  \ceq{\hfill\theta({\mr\bar x})}{\imp}{\phi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr b})\vee\psi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr b})}

  where ${\mr\bar x}={\mr x_1},\dots,{\mr x_n}$ and 

  \ceq{\hfill\phi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr b})}{=}{\bigvee_{i=1}^n\phi({\mr x_i}\,;{\gr b})}

  \ceq{\hfill\psi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr b})}{=}{\bigvee_{i=1}^n\psi({\mr x_i}\,;{\gr b})}

  Note that $\phi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr z})$ is a stable formula.
  Therefore we can apply what proved above to the formulas $\phi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr b})$ and $\psi'({\mr\bar x}\,;{\gr b})$ and note that these formulas are satisfied in every model $M\supseteq A$ if and only if $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$, respectively $\psi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$, are.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{corol_stable_coheir_over_models}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ be stable.
  Let $q({\mr x})\subseteq L(A)$ be a consistent type.
  Then there is a global $\phi$-type $p({\mr x})\in S_{\phi}(\U)$ such that $q({\mr x})\cup p({\mr x})$ is finitely satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  Let $p({\mr x})\subseteq L(\U)$ be maximal such that $q({\mr x})\cup p({\mr x})$ is finitely satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$.
  We prove that $p({\mr x})$ is complete.
  Suppose not that there a conjuction $\theta({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_1},\dots,{\gr b_n})$ of formulas in $q({\mr x})\cup p({\mr x})$ and a formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ such that 

  \hfil$\theta({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_1},\dots,{\gr b_n})\wedge\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ \ \ and\ \   $\theta({\mr x}\,;{\gr b_1},\dots,{\gr b_n})\wedge\neg\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ 
 
  are not satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$.
  The disjunction of the two formulas is satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$ by the definition of $p({\mr x})$.
  Moreover the formulas obtained replacing ${\gr b},{\gr b_1},\dots,{\gr b_n}$ by ${\gr z},{\gr z_1},\dots,{\gr z_n}$ are stable.
  This contradict Theorem~\ref{lem_ziegler}
\end{proof}

% \begin{theorem}
% The following are equivalent
% \begin{itemize}
% \item[1.] $T$ is stable
% \item[2.] $|S(A)|\le|A|$ for some infinite cardinal $\lambda$, and all sets $A$ of cardinality $\le\lambda$
% \item[3.] $|S(A)|\le|A|$ for every set $A$ such that $|L|<\cf(A)$.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{theorem}

\section{Stationarity and symmetry}
\label{stationarity}

\def\ceq#1#2#3{\parbox{20ex}{$\displaystyle #1$}\medrel{#2}$\displaystyle  #3$}

We say that $T$ is a \emph{stable theory\/} if every formula is stable.
By Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula2} this is equivalent to requiring that all externally definable sets are definable.
Theorems in this section have a formulation that only requires the stability of a fixed formula $\phi({\mr x},{\gr z})\in L$.
This is sometimes called \textit{local\/} stability.

We begin with a fundamental theorem.

\begin{theorem}[ (Symmetry)]\label{thm_symmetry}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L(M)$ be stable.
  For every ${\mr a},{\gr b}$ such that ${\mr a}\cnonfork_M{\gr b}$

  \ceq{\hfill\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})}{\IMP}{\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr M})\neq\0}
\end{theorem}

Note that the theorem proves that, when $T$ is stable, 

\ceq{\hfill{\mr a}\cnonfork_M{\gr b}}{\IMP}{{\gr b}\cnonfork_M{\mr a}}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})$.
  Let $\V\preceq\U$ be isomorphic to $\U$ over $M$ and such that ${\gr b}\in\V^{\gr z}$ and ${\mr a}\cnonfork_M\V$. Such $\V$ exists by Proposition~\ref{prop_saturate_heir}.
  By stability, there is $\psi({\gr z})\in L(\V)$ such that $\psi({\gr\V})=\phi({\mr a},{\gr\V})$.
  Recall that by Lemma~\ref{lem_coheir_independence} (non-splitting) if ${\gr b'}\equiv_M{\gr b''}$ are in $\V$ then ${\gr b'}\equiv_{M,\kern.2ex{\mr a}}{\gr b''}$.
  Then $\psi({\gr\V})$ is invariant under $\Aut(\V/M)$, so we can assume that $\psi({\gr z})\in L(M)$.
  Therefore $\psi({\gr z})$ is satisfied in $M$ and so is $\phi({\mr a},{\gr z})$.
\end{proof}

We deduce a version of Harrington's mysterious Lemma cfr.~\cite[Lemma 8.3.4]{TZ}.

\begin{corollary}\label{corol_harrington0}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ be stable.
  Let ${\mr a}\in{\mr\U^x}$ and ${\gr b}\in{\gr\U^z}$.
  Let $\theta({\mr x}),\psi({\gr z})\in L(M)$ be such that $\theta({\gr M})=\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr M})$ and $\psi({\mr M})=\phi({\mr M}\,;{\gr b})$ (these exist by stability).
  Then $\theta({\gr b})\iff\psi({\mr a})$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  We can assume that ${\mr a}\cnonfork_M{\gr b}$.
  First, assume $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})$.
  Then $\psi({\mr a})$ otherwise, by ${\mr a}\cnonfork_M{\gr b}$, we would contradict $\psi({\mr M})=\phi({\mr M}\,;{\gr b})$.
  We claim that $\theta({\gr b})$.
  Suppose not.
  Then $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})\wedge\neg\theta({\gr b})$.
  As $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge\neg\theta({\gr z})$ is stable, Theorem~\ref{thm_symmetry} yelds $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr M})\sm\theta({\gr M})\neq\varnothing$ which contradicts  $\theta({\gr M})=\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr M)}$.
  Assuming $\neg\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})$ we obtain $\neg\psi({\mr a})$ and $\neg\theta({\gr b})$ by a symilar argument.
  Then $\theta({\gr b})\iff\psi({\mr a})$ as required.
\end{proof}

Now we show that under the assumption of stability Lascar invariance reduces to a tamer form of invariance.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop_type_over_acl2}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ be stable.
  Let $p({\mr x})\in S_\phi(\U)$. 
  Then the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}\in \acl^\eq\!A$
  \item[2.] $p({\mr x})$ is finitely satisfied in every $M\supseteq A$
  \item[3.] $p({\mr x})$ is invariant over $\acl^\eq\!A$
  \item[4.] $p({\mr x})$ is Lascar invariant over $A$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
  \ssf{2}$\IMP$\ssf{3}$\IMP$\ssf{4} (and even \ssf{1}$\IMP$\ssf{3}) are clear~--~stability is not required.

  \ssf{1}$\IMP$\ssf{2}
  Let $M\supseteq A$ be given.
  First, for simplicity, we prove that any $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})\in p$ is satisfied in $M$.
  Let $\psi({\gr z})\in L(\acl^\eq\!A)$ be a formula defining ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$.
  Pick any ${\mr a}\models p({\mr x}){\restriction} M$ such that ${\gr b}\cnonfork_M{\mr a}$.
  As $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr M})=\psi({\gr M})$ we have that $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})=\psi({\gr b})$.
  But $\psi({\gr b})$ holds because $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})\in p$, hence $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr b})$ and, from Theorem~\ref{thm_symmetry} we obtain $\phi({\mr M}\,;{\gr b})\neq\0$.
  The same argument extends easily to the conjunction of formulas of the form $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr b})$ and negation thereof (use that the complement and the Cartesian product of sets in $\acl^\eq\!A$ is again $\acl^\eq\!A$).
 
  \ssf{3}$\IMP$\ssf{1} By Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula2} the sets ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ are definable (over $\U$).
  As $p({\mr x})$ is Lascar invariant over $A$, so are the sets ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$.
  Hence they belong to $\acl^\eq\!A$ by Corollary~\ref{coroll_defble_Lascar_inv}.
\end{proof}

A type $q({\mr x})\subseteq L(A)$ is \emph{stationary\/} if it has a unique global extension that is Lascar invariant over $A$.
The following proposition says that in a stable theory with elimination of imaginaries types over algebraically closed sets are stationary (the actual statement is a local version of this property).

\begin{theorem}[ (Stationarity)]\label{thm_stationarity}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ be stable.
  Let $q({\mr x})\in S\big(\acl^\eq\!A\big)$.
  Then there is a unique global $\phi$-type $p({\mr x})\in S_\phi(\U)$ that is invariant over $\acl^\eq A$ and consistent with $q({\mr x})$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Existence follows from Corollary~\ref{corol_stable_coheir_over_models}.
  Let $q_i({\mr x})\in S(\U^\eq)$, for $i=1,2$, be two global $\phi$-types that extend $q({\mr x})$ and are invariant over $\acl^\eq\!A$.
  Let $p({\gr z})\in S_\phi(\U)$ be invariant over $\acl^\eq\!A$ and consistent with $\tp({\gr b}/\acl^\eq\!A)$.
  Let $\theta({\mr x})\in L(\acl^\eq\!A)$ be the formula ${\mr x}\in{\mr\D_{p,\phi^{\rm op}}}$.
  Let $\psi_i({\gr z})\in L(\acl^\eq\!A)$ be the formula ${\gr z}\in{\gr\D_{q_i,\phi}}$.
  We claim that $\psi_1({\gr b})\iff\psi_2({\gr b})$, for any ${\gr b}\in\U^{\gr z}$.
  Let $M$ be any model containing $A$.
  Let ${\gr b'}\models p({\gr z}){\restriction}M$ and ${\mr a_i}\models q_i({\mr x}){\restriction}M$.
  Then $\theta({\mr M})=\phi({\mr M}\,;{\gr b'})$ and $\psi_i({\gr M})=\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr M})$.
  By Corollary~\ref{corol_harrington0} $\psi_i({\gr b'})\iff\theta({\mr a_i})$.
  As ${\mr a_1}\equiv_{\acl^\eq\!A}{\mr a_2}$ we obtain $\psi_1({\gr b'})\iff\psi_2({\gr b'})$.
  As ${\gr b}\equiv_{\acl^\eq\!A}{\gr b'}$, the claim follows and with it the theorem.
\end{proof}

If $p({\mr x})\in S(\U)$ is a global type, a \emph{canonical base\/} of $p({\mr x})$ is a definably closed set $\emph{$\Cb(p)$}\subseteq \U^\eq$ such that an automorphism $f\in\Aut(\U)$ fixes $p({\mr x})$ if and only if it fixes $\Cb(p)$ pointwise. When they exist, canonical bases are unique, see Exercise~\ref{ex_Cb}.
Clearly, all definable types (Definition~\ref{def_defble_type}) have a canonical base, namely

\ceq{\hfill\Cb(p)}{=}{{\dcl}^\eq\Big(\big\{{\gr\D_{p,\phi}}\ :\ \phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L\big\}\Big).}

Therefore if $T$ is stable, all global types have a canonical base.

% \begin{proposition}\label{prop_type_over_dcl} Let $T$ be stable and let $p({\mr x})\in S(\U)$ be Lascar invariant over $A$. Then for every formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ the set ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ belongs to $\dcl^\eq(A,c)$ for every $c\models p_{\restriction A}(x)$.
% \end{proposition}
% \begin{proof}
% Without loss of generality we can assume $p({\mr x})\in S(\U^\eq)$.

The following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] ${\mr a}\equivL_A{\mr b}$, see Definition~\ref{def_Lascar_type}
\item[2.] ${\mr a}\equivSh_A{\mr b}$, see Definition~\ref{def_Sh_strong_type}.

  This is left as an exercise to the reader (stability is not required).

  \ssf{2}$\IMP$\ssf{1}.
  Assume ${\mr a}\equivSh_A{\mr b}$.
  By Proposition~\ref{prop_Shelah_strong_types} this is equivalent to ${\mr a}\equiv_{\acl^\eq\!A}{\mr b}$.
  Let $q({\mr x})=\tp({\mr a}/{\acl}^\eq\!A)=\tp({\mr b}/{\acl}^\eq\!A)$. Let $p({\mr x})\in S(\U^\eq)$ be the unique global type that is invariant over $\acl^\eq\!A$ and extends $q({\mr x})$ which we obtain from by Theorem~\ref{thm_stationarity}.
  Let ${\mr\bar c}=\<{\mr c_i}:i<\omega\>$ be such that ${\mr c_i}\models p({\mr x}){\restriction}\acl^\eq(A),\,{\mr a},\,{\mr b},\,{\mr c_{\restriction i}}$.
  Then ${\mr a},{\mr\bar c}$ and ${\mr b},{\mr\bar c}$ are $A$-indiscernible sequences, which proves \ssf{1}, see Exercise~\ref{ex_Lstp_indiscernibles}.

The following theorem presents a property of definability that seems to go in the opposite direction.
This has an application in ...
We first prove a special case of the theorem case that is simpler.

\begin{proposition}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L(\U)$ be stable.
  Let $M$ and ${\mr a}\in\U^{\mr x}$ be arbitrary.
  Then, for some ${\mr a_1}\equiv_M\dots\equiv_M{\mr a_n}\equiv_M{\mr a}$, some positive Boolean combination of the sets $\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr\U})$ is definable over $M$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\V\preceq\U$ be isomorphic to $\U$.
  By Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula} with $\V$ for $\U$, there are ${\mr a_1},\dots,{\mr a_n}$ as above such that $\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr\V})$ is a positive Bolean combination of the sets $\phi({\mr a_i},;{\gr\V})$.
  Let $\theta({\mr a_1},\dots,{\mr a_n}\,;{\gr\V})$ be such a Boolean combination.
  Now, by Proposition~\ref{prop_saturate_heir}. we can chose $\V$ such that ${\mr a}\nonfork_M\V$.
  By non-splitting, i.e.\@ reasoning as in Theorem~\ref{thm_symmetry}, there is a formula $\psi({\gr z})\in L(M)$ such that $\psi({\gr\V})=\phi({\mr a}\,;{\gr\V})$.
  Finally, by elementarity, we obtain that $\psi({\gr\U})=\theta({\mr a_1},\dots,{\mr a_n}\,;{\gr\U})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L(\U)$ be stable.
  Let $A$ and ${\mr a}\in\U^{\mr x}$ be arbitrary.
  Then, for some ${\mr a_1}\equiv_A\dots\equiv_A{\mr a_n}\equiv_A{\mr a}$, some positive Boolean combination of the sets $\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr\U})$ is definable over $A$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $q({\mr x})=\tp({\mr a}/A)$.
    By Corollary~\ref{corol_stable_coheir_over_models} there is a type $p({\mr x})\in S_\phi(\U)$ consistent with $q({\mr x})$ and invariant over $\acl^\eq\!A$.
    By Theorem~\ref{thm_def_stable_formula} there are ${\mr a_1},\dots,{\mr a_n}\models q({\mr x})$ such that ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ is a positive Bolean combination of the sets $\phi({\mr a_i},;{\gr\U})$.
    Let $\theta({\mr a_1},\dots,{\mr a_n}\,;{\gr\U})$ be such a Boolean combination.
    By Proposition~\ref{prop_type_over_acl2} ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}\in\acl^\eq\!A$.
    This completes the proof if $A=\acl^\eq\!A$.
    For the general case, reason as follows.
    Let $f_1,\dots,f_n\in\Aut(\U/A)$ be such that the sets $f_i{\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ span the whole orbit of ${\gr\D_{p,\phi}}$ over $A$.
    Clearly,

    \ceq{\hfill\bigcup_{i=1}^n f_i{\gr\D_{p,\phi}}}{=}{\bigvee_{i=1}^n\theta(f_i{\mr a_1},\dots,f_i{\mr a_n}\,;{\gr\U})}

   As the set on the l.h.s.\@ is definable over $A$, the formula on the r.h.s.\@ is the required positive Boolean combination.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}\label{ex_Cb}
  Let $p({\mr x})\in S(\U)$. Prove that there is at most one definably closed set $A\subseteq\U^\eq$ such that $\Aut(\U/A)$ is the set of automorphisms that fix $p({\mr x})$.\QED

\section{Stable theories}

\begin{theorem}[ (Pierre Simon)]
  If every formula $\phi(x\,;y)\in L(\U)$, where $|x|=|y|=1$, is stable then $T$ is stable.
\end{theorem} 

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\phi(x\,;y,z)\in L(\U)$ is not stable.
  We prove that there is a formula $\psi(x\,;y)\in L(\U)$ that is not stable.
  Let $\<a_i\,;b_i,c_i\ :\ i\in\QQ\>$ is a sequence of indiscernibles such that 

  \ceq{\hfill i< j}{\IFF}{\phi(a_i\,;b_j,c_j)}\hfill for all $i,j\in\QQ$.

  Let $\QQ^*=\QQ\sm\{0\}$.
  Assume first that the sequence $\<a_i\ :\ i\in\QQ^*\>$ is indiscernible over $c_0$.
  Then for every $k\in\QQ^*$ the type below is consistent

  \ceq{\hfill p_k(y)}{=}{\{\phi(a_i\;y,c_0)\iff i<k\ \ :\ i\in\QQ^*\sm\{k\}\}.}

  In fact, by indiscernibility, $b_0$ witnesses the consistency of all finite subsets of $p_k(y)$.
  Let $b'_k\models p_k(y)$.
  Then

  \ceq{\hfill i< k}{\IFF}{\phi(a_i\,;b'_k,c_0)}\hfill for all $i,j\in\QQ^*, i\neq j$

  From this the instability of $\psi(x\,;y)=\phi(x\,;y,c_0)$ follows easily.

  Now, assume instead that $\<a_i\ :\ i\in\QQ^*\>$ is not indiscernible over $c_0$.
  Note that the sequences $\<a_i\ :\ i<0\>$ and $\<a_i\ :\ i>0\>$ are mutually indiscernible over $c_0$.
  Then there is a maximal $n$ such that

  \ceq{\hfill a_{\restriction\{-1,\dots,-n\}}}{\equiv_{c_0}}{a_{\restriction\{1,\dots,n\}}.}

  Let $A=a\restriction\{\pm1,\dots,\pm n\}$.
  By maximality, $a_i\nequiv_{c_0,A}a_j$ for every $-1<i<0<j<1$.
  Let $\psi(x\;y)$ be a formula such that $\psi(a_i\,;c_0)$ and $\neg\psi(a_j\,;c_0)$.
  We claim that for every $k\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)$ the type below is consistent

  \ceq{\hfill q_k(z)}{=}{\{\psi(a_i\;y)\iff i<k\ \ :\ i\in (-1,0)\cup(0,1)\}.}

  In fact as $\<a_i\ :\ i\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)\>$ is indiscernible over $A$, all finite subsets of $q_k(z)$ are realized by $c_0$.
  Finally let $c'_k\models p_k(z)$.
  Then $\<a_i,c'_i\ :\ i\in(-1,0)\cup(0,1)\>$ witness the instability of $\psi(x\;z)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}
  Prove that if every formula $\phi(x\,;z)\in L$, where $|x|=1$, is stable then $T$ is stable.\QED
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise} 
  A sequence $\<a_i:i<\omega\>$ is totally indiscernible if $a_1,\dots,a_n\equiv a_{i_1},\dots,a_{i_n}$ for every distinct $i_1,\dots,i_n$.
  Prove that the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] $T$ is stable
  \item[2.] every indiscernible sequence is totally indiscernible.\QED

\begin{exercise}\label{ex_stable_orderproperty}
Prove that the following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $T$ is unstable
\item[2.] there is an infinite set $A\subseteq\U^n$ and a formula  $\psi(x\,;y)$, with $|x|=|y|=n$ such that $A$ is linearly ordered by the relation $a<b\iff\psi(a\,;b)$.\QED

\section{Stable groups}

In this section $\U$ has two type-definable sets $\G$ and $\S$ where $\G$ is a group that acts from the left on $\S$.
The group operations and the group action are definable.
We use the symbol $\,\cdot\,$ for both the group multiplication and the group action.

We say tha the set $\X\subseteq\S$ is relatively definable if it is the intersection of a definable set with $\S$.

We say that $\X\subseteq\S$ is generic if there are some finitely many $g_1,\dots,g_n\in\U$ such that the sets $g_i\X$ cover $\U$.

Let $\D\subseteq\S$ be a relatively definable set.
Let $L'$ be a two-sorted language.
The sorts are called $\G$ and $\S$.
There is only one binary relation symbol $r(x,y)$ that has sort $\G\times\S$.
We write $\langle\G, \S\, \D\rangle$ for the $L'$-structure that has domain $\langle\G, \S\rangle$ and interpretes $r(x,y)$ as follows 

\ceq{\hfill\langle\G,\S, \D\rangle\models r(g,a)}{\Leftrightarrow}{a\in g\cdot\D}

Note that $\D$ is definable in $\langle\G,\S, \D\rangle$ by the formula $r(1,y)$.
The action of $\G$ on $\U$ defined by left multiplication on $\G$ and $\S$ is an $L'$-automorphisms.
Therefore we may identify $\G$ with a common subgroup of the groups $L'\mbox{-Aut}\U,{\D})$ as $\D$ ranges over the definable subsets of $\S$.

\begin{fact}
  The structure $\langle\G,\S, \D\rangle$ is saturated.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  First note that the sets defined by $r(x,y)$ and by $\neg r(x,y)$ in $\langle\G,\S, \D\rangle$ are a type-definable subsets of $\U$.
  It follows that the sets defined by $L'$-formulas are type-definables subsets of $\U$.
  Therefore the saturation of $\langle\G,\S, \D\rangle$ follows from the saturation of $\U$.
\end{proof}

%A set $\EuScript X\subseteq\U$ is generic if there are some finitely many $g_1,\dots,g_n\in\U$ such that the sets $g_i\EuScript X$ cover $\U$.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_generic_G_L}
Let $\D\subseteq\S$ be a definable set.
Write $G_{\D}$ for $L'$-$\Aut(\G,\S,{\D})$.
Then the following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
  \item[1.] $\D$ is $G_{\D}$-generic
  \item[2.] $\D$ is $\G$-generic.
\end{itemize}
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  The equivalence follows from the fact that the orbits of $\D$ under the action of $G_{\D}$ and $\G$ coincide.
  In fact, for $f\in L'\mbox{-Aut}(\G,\S,\D)$ let $g=f1$.
  Then $f{\D}=g\cdot\D$.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}
  Assume $\S=\G$, where $\G$ acts on itself by translation. 
  Let $\mu$ be S1 and invariant under $\G$-translation.
  If $\D\subseteq\G$ is $\mu$-wide then $\D\cdot\D^{-1}$ is $\G$-generic.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  Let $A\subseteq\G$ be maximal such that $a\cdot\D\cap b\cdot\D=\varnothing$ for every distinct $a,b \in A$.
  By maximality for every $b\in\G$ there is an $a\in A$ such that $b\cdot\D\cap a\cdot\D\neq\varnothing$.
  That is, there are $d_1,d_2\in\D$ such that $b=a\cdot d_2\cdot d_1^{-1}$.
  This shows that the $A$-translates of $\D\cdot\D^{-1}$ cover $\G$.
  It suffices to prove that $A$ is finite.
  Suppose not, then we can find a indiscernible sequence $\langle a_i:i<\omega\rangle$ such that $a_0\cdot\D\cap a_1\cdot\D=\varnothing$.
  Then $a_0\cdot\D$ is not wide and, by tranlation invariance, $\D$ is not wide, contrary to our assumption.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\D\subseteq\S$ be a definable set.
  Assume that $r(x,y)$ is stable in $\langle\G,\S,\D\rangle$.
  Assume also that $\G$ acts transitively on $\S$, i.e.\@ there is a unique $\G$-orbit.
  Then either $\D$ or $\S\smallsetminus\D$ is $\G$-generic.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Assume $\S\smallsetminus\D$ is not $\G$-generic.
  We claim that $\D$ is $\G$-generic.
  By Fact~\ref{fact_generic_G_L} $\S\smallsetminus\D$ is not $G_{\D}$-generic.
  By Fact~\ref{fact_ig} there is a global $G_{\D}$-invariant type $p(x)$ containing $r(x,1)$.
  By stability, there is a positive Boolean combination of sets in the $G_{\D}$-orbit of $\D$ that is $L'$-definable over $\varnothing$.
  By the transitivity of the action, $\S$ is the only set that is $L'$-definable over $\varnothing$.
  Therefore some disjunction of sets in the $G_{\D}$-orbit of $\D$ cover $\S$.
  As the $G_{\D}$-orbit and the $\G$-orbit of $\D$ coincide, the claim follows.
\end{proof}

Let $p(x)$ be a global type containing $x\in\S$ we define

\ceq{\hfill g\cdot p(x)}{=}{\big\{\varphi(g^{-1}\cdot x)\ :\ \varphi(x)\in p\big\}}

and

\ceq{\hfill{\rm Stab}(p)}{=}{\big\{g\in\G\ :\ g\cdot p(x)=p(x)\big\}.}
