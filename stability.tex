\section{The ladder property}

The \emph{ladder order\/} of a parted formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ is the largest ordinal $n$ such that for some ${\mr a_i}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ and ${\gr b_i}\in\U^{|{\gr z}|}$ 


\section{}

We say that $\D\subseteq\U^{|{\gr z}|}$ is \emph{approximable\/} by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ if for every finite $B\subseteq\U^{|{\gr z}|}$ there is a ${\mr a}\in\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ such that $\phi({\mr a}\,;B)=\D\cap B$. For $A\subseteq\U$, we say approximable \emph{over $A$\/} if we can further require that ${\mr a}\in A^{|{\mr x}|}$. We say \emph{almost over $A$\/} if  ${\mr a}\in M^{|{\mr x}|}$ for every model $M$ containing $A$.

\begin{proposition}
If\/ $\D$ is\/ approximable from $A$, then it is invariant over $A$. If it is\/ ap\-prox\-i\-ma\-ble almost over $A$, then it is Lascar invariant over $A$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Suppose for a contradiction that $f[\D]\neq\D$ for some $f\in\Aut(\U/A)$. Pick some ${\gr b}$ such that ${\gr b}\in\D\niff f{\gr b}\in\D$. Clearly $\big\{{\gr b},f{\gr b}\big\}\cap\D$ cannot be the trace on $\big\{{\gr b},f{\gr b}\big\}$ of a set definable over $A$. The same argument apply to prove Lascar invariance.
\end{proof}

Tentativo

Let $D\subseteq A$ be the trace on $A$ of a definable set, then it is the trace of some set $\Aa$ definable over $\acl^\eq A$, and such a set $\Aa$ is unique.

We write, $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})^*$ for $\phi({\gr z}\,;{\mr x})$. Clearly, these are the same formula, but they are different as parted formula. We say that they are dual of each other.

The following is a version of Harrinton's mysterious 
Lemma (cfr.~\cite[Lemma 8.3.4]{TZ}).
\begin{lemma}\label{lem_harrington}
Let $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ be a stable formula and suppose $\B\subseteq\U^{|{\gr z}|}$ and $\Aa\subseteq\U^{|{\mr x}|}$ are approximated by $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$ and  $\phi({\gr z}\,;{\mr x})$, respectively. Then the following are equivalent
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge{\mr x}\in{\Aa}$ approximates $\B$
\item[2.] $\phi({\gr z}\,;{\mr x})\wedge{\gr z}\in{\B}$ approximates $\Aa$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
It suffices to prove \ssf{1}$\IMP$\ssf{2} because the converse implication is equivalent. Assume \ssf{1} and negate \ssf{2} for a contradiction.  As $\Aa$ is approximable, if not \ssf{2}, then  $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge{\gr z}\notin{\B}$ approximates $\Aa$. Pick ${\mr a_0}$ arbitrarily, then recursively find ${\gr b_i}\notin\B$ and  ${\mr a_i}\in\Aa$ such that


{\def\medrel#1{\parbox[t]{12ex}{$\displaystyle\kern2ex #1$}}

\ceq{\hfill\phi(\U\,;{\gr b_i})}{ =_{{\mr a_0},\dots,{\mr a_{i-1}}}}{\Aa} 


\ceq{\hfill\phi({\mr a_i}\,;\U)}{ =_{{\gr b_0},\dots,{\gr b_i}}}{\B}
}

Then

{\def\medrel#1{\parbox[t]{6ex}{$\displaystyle\kern2ex #1$}}

\ceq{\hfill i< j}{\IMP}{\phantom{\neg}\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_j})}

\ceq{\hfill j\le i}{\IMP}{\neg\phi({\mr a_i}\,;{\gr b_j})}

}

Which contradicts the stability of $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})$.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Under the same assumptions of Lemma~\ref{lem_harrington} the following are mutually exclusive\nobreak
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge{\gr z}\notin{\B}$ approximates $\Aa$;
\item[2.] $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\wedge{\gr z}\in{\B}$ approximates $\Aa$.\QED
\end{itemize}
\end{corollary}

}

\begin{proposition}
Let $A\subseteq\U$ and $\D\subseteq\U^{|{\gr z}|}$. Suppose that some stable formula $\phi({\mr x}\,;{\gr z})\in L$ approximates $\D\subseteq\U^{|{\gr z}|}$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] $\D$ is invariant over $\acl^\eq A$;
\item[2.] $\D$ is definable over $\acl^\eq A$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Only \ssf{1}$\IMP$\ssf{2} requires a proof. Assume \ssf{1}. By stability, $\D$ is definable. By invariance, $\D\in M^\eq$ for every model $M$ containing $A$ and \ssf{2} follows.
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
For every $M$ and every externally definable set $\D$ is some $\B\equiv_M\D$ that is approximable in $M$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
